<P>The standard Berkeley Sockets SOCK_RAW socket type, is normally used to 
create ping (echo request/reply), and sometimes traceroute applications (the 
original traceroute application from Van Jacobson used UDP, rather than ICMP). 
Microsoft's WinSock version 2 implementations for NT4 and Windows 95 support <A 
href="http://www.sockets.com/ws2_stat.htm#TCPIP">raw sockets and 
setsockopt(IP_TTL)</A>, but none of their WinSock version 1.1implementations 
(WFWG, NT3.x or standard Windows 95) did.</P>
<P>Microsoft has their own API for an ICMP.DLL that their ping and tracert 
applications use (which are both non-GUI text-based console applications). This 
is a proprietary API, and all function calls that involve network functions 
operate in blocking mode. They still include it with WinSock 2 implementations, 
and are documented for the <A href="http://www.sockets.com/ws_wince.htm">Windows 
CE</A> platform (though the DLL is not yet available).</P>

<P>See <A 
href="http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/sdkdoc/wince/network_2gz7.htm">http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/sdkdoc/wince/network_2gz7.htm</A> 
for documentation on the Microsoft ICMP APIs for Windows CE (NOTE:&nbsp;You may 
have to subscribe to access this premium website, but fortunately Microsoft does 
not charge for access). I have summarized the essentials in my <A 
href="http://www.sockets.com/MS_ICMP.H">header file</A> in my <A 
href="http://www.sockets.com/ms_icmp.htm#Sample">sample ping 
application</A>.</P>
<P>I first found the Microsoft ICMP&nbsp;API documented in the Win32 SDK in 
\MSTOOLS\ICMP, and then later on the MS&nbsp;Developers' Network CD-ROM, and 
most recently the&nbsp;Microsoft Visual C++ ICMP.LIB and ICMPAPI.H&nbsp;became 
available as part of the "Microsoft Platform SDK: Additional Components," which 
is downloadable from <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/other.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/other.htm</A> 
(NOTE:&nbsp;Microsoft rearranges their website frequently, in which case this 
URL may become invalid. If it does, please let <A 
href="mailto:rcq@sockets.com">me</A> know. In the mean time, you can poke around 
the SDK developers' websites and <I>maybe</I> find what you need).</P>
<P>Microsoft <I>used to</I> disclaim this API about as strongly as possible. The 
README.TXT that once accompanied it said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>[DISCLAIMER]</P>
  <P>We have had requests in the past to expose the functions exported from 
  icmp.dll. The files in this directory are provided for your convenience in 
  building applications which make use of ICMPSendEcho(). Notice that the 
  functions in icmp.dll are not considered part of the Win32 API and will not be 
  supported in future releases. Once we have a more complete solution in the 
  operating system, this DLL, and the functions it exports, will be dropped.</P>
  <P><BR>[DOCUMENTATION] </P>
  <P>The ICMPSendEcho() function sends an ICMP echo request to the specified 
  destination IP address and returns any replies received within the timeout 
  specified. The API is synchronous, requiring the process to spawn a thread 
  before calling the API to avoid blocking. An open IcmpHandle is required for 
  the request to complete. IcmpCreateFile() and IcmpCloseHandle() functions are 
  used to create and destroy the context handle.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Despite this frightening warning, seems Microsoft changed their mind. It 
doesn't look like the API going away any time soon, as it remains available in 
new platforms. Fortunately, we have an alternative with <A 
href="http://www.sockets.com/ws2_stat.htm#TCPIP">raw sockets and 
setsockopt(IP_TTL)</A> support in WinSock 2 implementations.</P>

  <P>I have written a console ping application that emulates the Microsoft ping 
  program shipped with Windows 95 and NT. The source code module and header file 
  are all you need. t loads the ICMP DLL explicitly). </P>
  <P>With Microsoft Visual C++, you can compile and link by typing <B><I>cl 
  ms_icmp.c</I></B>. To do this, you will need to enable the build environment 
  in the console (the "DOS box") with the VCVARS32.BAT (located in the /bin 
  directory, e.g. c:\msdev\bin or c:\Program Files\DevStudio\bin).</P>
